# Online-Taxi-Booking-System
This project is an online taxi booking system developed as part of my first-semester coursework at SLIATE. It offers a simple, intuitive platform for passengers to book taxis and drivers to accept and manage ride requests. The system focuses on basic booking functionalities without advanced features like real-time tracking or an admin dashboard, providing a streamlined approach to managing taxi rides.

Key Features:
* User Registration and Login: Secure accounts for both passengers and drivers.

* Ride Booking: Easy-to-use interface for passengers to request a taxi.

* Ride Management: Drivers can accept, manage, and complete ride requests.

This project helped me improve my skills in web development, focusing on essential functionalities for building a practical, user-friendly taxi booking system. Feel free to check out the code and explore the repository!
